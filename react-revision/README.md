- Controlled Component

- Using e.preventDefault() allows you to manage the form submission yourself. This means you can collect data, validate it, display messages, or send it to a server without the page refreshing.

- props 

stands for properties. Used to transfer data from one component to another. Read-only. Just like parameters in function in javascript. 

- prop drilling, Context API (Create, Provider, Consumer) and useContext hook (create, Provider, useContext)

- is Context API also problematic just like prop drilling ? 

Parent -> Child A -> Child B -> Child C

- name, value and htmlFor (for) attribute in form

- function vs class components

- Lifecycle of class components (mounting, updating and unmounting)

1. Mounting: These methods are called when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM 

    constructor(), render(), componentDidMount()

2. Updating: These methods are called when a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to props or state.

    render(), componentDidUpdate()

3. Unmounting: This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM 

    componentDidUnmount()
